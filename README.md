## About
Do you know the feeling when something crosses your mind you certainly want to remember to do later? An alarm is the best solution you know of? Then you haven't come across SimpleReminder yet!

This app lets you set up a reminder in very few steps:

1. Click "Add Reminder" on your home screen or use the Quick Settings Tile
2. Select a time, enter a message
3. Click OK

The reminder is saved and will pop up at the time set.


## Project status
SimpleReminder is currently under development, and new features are added continuously. Your [feedback](#feedback) is welcome!

  - Use the launcher icon or the Quick Settings tile
- When a reminder is due, a notification is shown (with customizable importance and optional sound)

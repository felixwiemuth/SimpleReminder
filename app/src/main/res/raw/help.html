    <h3>Adding a reminder</h3>
    <p>Reminders are added via the "Add reminder" dialog, which can be reached in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the <b>launcher icon</b> "Add reminder"</li>
        <li>Long-click on the launcher icon "SimpleReminder" and select "Add reminder"</li>
        <li>Use the <b>Quick Settings tile</b> (has to be first added by editing the menu)</li>
        <li>Click the "+" button in the reminders list</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then select a time using the clock widget and enter a message.
    To add the reminder, either click the "Add" button on the keyboard (usually a button on the bottom right, with a symbol or titled "Add") or click "Add" at the bottom of the dialog.</p>
    <p>After adding a reminder, the remaining time until its due date is shown (rounded down to minutes/hours).</p>

    <h3>Nagging reminders</h3>
    <p>The switch next to the reminder text makes the reminder "nagging": when due, the notification will be renewed every x minutes (by default as configured in the settings), producing the same alert (sound, vibration, ...) as when first shown. This continues until the notification is dismissed.</p>

    <p>The repeat interval for the current reminder can be adjusted by long-clicking the switch.</p>

    <p>Note that changing the default repeat interval in the settings does not affect already scheduled reminders.</p>

    <p>Currently there is no indication in the reminders list or the notification whether a reminder is nagging, this will be added later.</p>

    <h3>Editing a reminder</h3>
    To edit a reminder, either click on the notification or the entry in the reminders list.

    <h3>Reminders list</h3>
    <p>The reminders list can be reached via the launcher icon "SimpleReminder" or via long-clicking on the "Add reminder" launcher icon and selecting "Reminders list".</p>
    <p>The reminders list shows all current and past reminders and allows to edit or reschedule them. In addition reminders can be marked as done or deleted. Long-click on a reminder to select it (and potentially further reminders) and see the available actions (a long click on an action symbol shows its name).</p>
    <p>The list consists of three sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Due reminders (yellow):</b> Reminders due according to the set time; a notification has been shown and the reminder has not yet been marked as done yet (e.g. by dismissing the notification)</li>
        <li><b>Scheduled reminders (green):</b> Reminders with due date in the future, a notification will be shown when the due time is reached; this section is further divided by day of the due date for the next 7 days</li>
        <li><b>Done reminders (grey):</b> Reminders for which the notification has been dismissed or which have been marked done manually</li>
      </ul>

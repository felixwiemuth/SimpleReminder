## Included work ##

This project incorporates third-party work covered by licenses other than this project's license. Third-party work is incorporated in two forms: modified and unmodified. Work incorporated into the `src/` directories of this project's modules may have been modified whereas work included in source or binary form under `lib/` directories or as a mere dependency link in build files (and thus only included in compiled executable forms of this project) is always unmodified. Full texts of the original licenses can be found under [LICENSES](LICENSES).

Note that the attributions for third-party work in the following are only complete for this project (the fork) and may not mention all third-party work included by the original project.

On first modification under GPL, a file's original copyright header may have been replaced by this project's copyright header, indicating that the derived work is distributed under GPL.

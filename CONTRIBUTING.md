## Contribution guidelines

### Procedure

To get the best results and avoid problems, please follow these steps:
1. First express your intentions using issues. Maybe there are already plans or work has been started on something you want to do.
2. We will discuss the issue. Maybe I will take part in implementation, giving feedback on the planned design or even write skeletons/APIs for you so you don't have to deal with too many internals.
3. When we have decided what to do, you can fork the project and send a pull request when ready.

* On Android 8+ replaced notification settings for sound and priority (which did not have any effect) with a link to the notification channel settings.
* Fixed: When scheduled reminders were marked as done or were deleted, they would still be shown at the due time (deleted reminders were attempted to be shown which led to a crash).
* Now ask to disable battery optimization on launch as this is essential to the working of SimpleReminder.
